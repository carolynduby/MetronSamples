# BotDAD model rest service

The BotDAD model used was provided in the notebook below by ManmeetSing, Maninder Singh, and Sanmeet Kaura.   

I modified the notebook to save the file to a pickle file using joblib.  I then created a rest service that loads the file and returns predictions.

```
joblib.dump(self.rf_classifier, model_file_name)
```

The original notebook provided by the authors is [https://github.com/mannirulz/BotDAD/blob/master/ML/BotDAD.ipynb]
